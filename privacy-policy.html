Last Updated: Feb 9, 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how Expense Note collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application.
We take your privacy seriously. Your personal expense notes and entries are stored securely on your device or in your personal cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) and are NOT accessed, collected, or stored by us.

1. Data Collected By The App Developer
Your application is designed to collect the absolute minimum amount of information necessary for the core features (sign-in and subscriptions) to function.
Data Type
How Collected
Purpose (Why Collected)
Google User ID (Unique Identifier)
Automatically upon successful use of "Sign in with Google."
To create a unique and secure account for you within the App and to link your subscription status and purchase history to your account.
Google Account Email (Used for Sign-In)
Automatically upon successful use of "Sign in with Google."
To verify your identity, send necessary account-related messages (like subscription renewal confirmations, if applicable), and to authenticate your subscription.

2. Information NOT Collected or Stored By the App
Crucially, we do NOT collect, store, or access the following data:
User-Generated Content: Your daily expense notes, entry details, category names, or any data entered into the note-taking feature. This data remains on your device or in your personal Google account storage.
Sensitive Personal Information: Financial details (beyond payment verification handled by Google Play), health data, precise location data, or contact information (other than your Sign-In email).

3. Data Collected by Third-Party Services
We use third-party services that may collect certain data from your device to provide their services, such as advertising and security. These parties are subject to their own privacy policies.
A. Google AdMob (Advertising)
The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements and generate revenue. AdMob automatically collects data to serve personalized and non-personalized ads, and for advertising analytics, and fraud prevention.
Data Type Collected by AdMob
Purpose (Why Collected by AdMob)
Device/Account Identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, App Set ID, IP address)
For advertising (personalized/non-personalized), analytics, and fraud detection.
User Product Interactions (e.g., app launches, taps, video views)
To measure the performance of ad campaigns and improve ad delivery.

B. Google Play Billing
The Google Play Store processes all subscription purchases. We rely on Google Play's service to verify your subscription status. Google processes your payment information (e.g., credit card details) as per their own Google Payments Privacy Policy. We do not receive or store your credit card or full payment information.


4. Data Security
We implement commercially reasonable technical and administrative security measures to protect the personal information we collect (mainly your Google User ID and email) from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
