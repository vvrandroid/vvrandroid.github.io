    <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for Expense Note</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 9, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Expense Note</strong> collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <div class="important-box">
        <strong>Google Drive & Data Storage:</strong> We take your privacy seriously. Your personal expense notes and entries are stored securely on your device or in your personal cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) and are <strong>NOT</strong> accessed, collected, or stored by us.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collected By The App Developer</h2>
    <p>Your application is designed to collect the absolute minimum amount of information necessary for the core features (sign-in and subscriptions) to function.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type</th>
                <th>How Collected</th>
                <th>Purpose (Why Collected)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Google User ID</strong><br>(Unique Identifier)</td>
                <td>Automatically upon successful use of "Sign in with Google."</td>
                <td>To create a unique and secure account for you within the App and to link your subscription status and purchase history to your account.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Google Account Email</strong><br>(Used for Sign-In)</td>
                <td>Automatically upon successful use of "Sign in with Google."</td>
                <td>To verify your identity, send necessary account-related messages (like subscription renewal confirmations), and to authenticate your subscription.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Purchase History</strong></td>
                <td>Processed via the app store payment system (Google Play).</td>
                <td>To verify your current subscription status, provide the service you paid for, and manage renewals or cancellations.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>2. Information NOT Collected or Stored By the App</h2>
    <div class="no-collect">
        <p>Crucially, we do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, store, or access the following data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Your daily expense notes, entry details, category names, or any data entered into the note-taking feature. This data remains on your device or in your personal Google account storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensitive Personal Information:</strong> Financial details (beyond payment verification handled by Google Play), health data, precise location data, or contact information (other than your Sign-In email).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services that may collect certain data from your device to provide their services, such as advertising and security. These parties are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>A. Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements and generate revenue. AdMob automatically collects data to serve personalized and non-personalized ads, and for advertising analytics, and fraud prevention.</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type Collected by AdMob</th>
                <th>Purpose (Why Collected by AdMob)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Device/Account Identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, IP address)</td>
                <td>For advertising (personalized/non-personalized), analytics, and fraud detection.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>User Product Interactions</td>
                <td>To measure the performance of ad campaigns and improve ad delivery.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Diagnostic Information (e.g., crash logs)</td>
                <td>To maintain the stability and performance of the advertising SDK.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
